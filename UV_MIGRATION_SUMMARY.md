# UV Migration Summary

The Shannon MCP project has been successfully migrated to use UV (Ultraviolet) as the primary build and dependency management system.

## What Changed

### 1. **Dependency Management**
- ✅ Replaced `requirements.txt` with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
- ✅ All dependencies are now managed through UV's fast resolver
- ✅ Deterministic builds with lockfile support

### 2. **Development Scripts**
- ✅ Created `dev.sh` - comprehensive development script for all common tasks
- ✅ Created `setup-uv.sh` - automated setup script for new developers
- ✅ All scripts now use `uv run` for consistent environment execution

### 3. **CI/CD Integration**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows updated to use UV
- ✅ Docker builds optimized with UV for faster dependency installation
- ✅ Added caching strategies for UV in CI pipelines

### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive UV Migration Guide
- ✅ Updated README with UV installation instructions
- ✅ Added development workflow documentation

## Key Benefits

1. **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip for dependency operations
2. **Reliability**: Lockfile ensures reproducible builds across all environments
3. **Simplicity**: Single tool replaces pip, pip-tools, venv, and more
4. **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Python Management**: UV can install and manage Python versions

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
./setup-uv.sh

# Common development tasks
./dev.sh help      # Show all commands
./dev.sh test      # Run tests
./dev.sh format    # Format code
./dev.sh dev       # Start server

# Package management
uv add package-name      # Add dependency
uv add --dev package     # Add dev dependency
uv sync                  # Sync environment
uv lock --upgrade-all    # Update all dependencies
```

## Files Added/Modified

### Added:
- `UV_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
- `dev.sh` - Development convenience script
- `setup-uv.sh` - Automated setup script
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release workflow

### Modified:
- `pyproject.toml` - Added UV configuration sections
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized for UV builds
- `README.md` - Updated installation instructions
- Test configurations - Updated to use pyproject.toml

### Removed:
- `requirements.txt` - No longer needed with UV

## Migration Checklist ✅

- [x] Install UV on development machines
- [x] Create UV-compatible project structure
- [x] Update all documentation
- [x] Create development scripts
- [x] Update CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Update Docker builds
- [x] Test all functionality
- [x] Remove old requirements.txt

## For New Developers

Simply run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shannon-mcp.git
cd shannon-mcp
./setup-uv.sh
```

This will:
1. Install UV if needed
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install all dependencies
4. Set up pre-commit hooks
5. Verify the installation

## For Existing Developers

After pulling the latest changes:
```bash
# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync your environment
uv sync

# You're ready to go!
```

## Rollback Plan

If you need to generate a requirements.txt for compatibility:
```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```

However, this should rarely be needed as UV is becoming the standard for Python projects.
