2. **Session UI Foundation** (Week 2)
   - Blocks: Tool widgets, message display
   
3. **Authentication System** (Week 2)
   - Blocks: Multi-user features, security
   
4. **Core REST APIs** (Week 5)

- **Backend Developer**: Full-time for 8 weeks, part-time for 4 weeks
- **UI/UX Designer**: Part-time for first 6 weeks
- **QA Engineer**: Part-time weeks 3-9, full-time weeks 10-12

### Infrastructure
- **Development Environment**: Local Docker setup
- **Staging Environment**: Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Risk Mitigation
