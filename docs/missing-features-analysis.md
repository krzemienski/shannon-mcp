## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Web UI (High Priority)
1. Basic session streaming UI
2. Essential tool widgets
3. Simple MCP server management
4. Basic agent execution

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. Checkpoint/timeline UI
2. Analytics dashboard
3. Import/export functionality
4. WebView preview

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
1. Visual editors
2. Advanced theming
3. Desktop integration
4. Cloud features

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- Use React with TypeScript (like Claudia)
- Implement WebSocket for streaming (replace Tauri events)
- Use TanStack Virtual for performance
- Implement proper error boundaries

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Consider Zustand/Valtio for global state
- Implement proper cleanup for subscriptions

### Performance
- Virtual scrolling for messages
- Lazy loading for components
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- WebSocket connection pooling

### Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for streaming
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Performance benchmarks
